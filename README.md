# STM32 host programmer implementation using USART AN3155
How to program a STM32 with another STM32 using the system bootloader interface

## Example
This example an implementaiton following the AN3155 protocol and AN2606 entry points.

## Hardware and Tools required
- Nucleo-L4R5ZI
- USB A to Micro USB B Cable 
- STM32CubeIDE (Tested on v1.13.2)
- STM32CubeProg (Tested on v2.14.0)
- Teraterm(v4.106 or higher) is recommended, although any terminal emulator software can be used.
